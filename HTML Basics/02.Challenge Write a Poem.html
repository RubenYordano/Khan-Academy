    <h1>Poem about someone?</h1>
        <p> Coming closer once you tell me ...<br>
Is this love?(x2)<br>
You are the only thing I see when I close my eyes...<br>
Is this love? (x3)<br>
You are the reason that I breathe..<br>
Is this love? (x2)<br>
Since I met you my life has a new meaning.<br>
Is this love?(x12)<br>
When you are not here I feel so incomplete.<br>
Is this love? (x12)<br>
I have been searching all my life for a girl like you.<br>
Just like you (x2)<br>
I have never known what it means to be in love ..
Is this love? (x12)</p>
